This folder contains some old beat/subdiv files.  These were used for everything, but I regenerated them at the very end of writing the piece when I altered the last couple of time points to produce the slow isochronous chords at the end of the piece.  The contents of the newer files in the main dir should be exactly the same except for the following:

--The file in this dir that contains subdivisions of 7 really contains subdivisions of 3.5
--timepoints 18 and 19 are different
